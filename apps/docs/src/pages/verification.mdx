# Contract Verification 

Modular Cloud enables [NautScan](https://nautscan.com) users to verify contracts on the [Nautilus Mainnet network](https://docs.nautchain.xyz/nautilus-mainnet), powered by [Sourcify](https://sourcify.dev/). This feature will be released generally to all chains in the future.

## Verifying your contract

You can quickly [verify contracts from this web page](https://contract-verification.vercel.app/).

Watch [this video tutorial](https://youtu.be/RA-z7K21dmk) and follow the instructions below.

1. Click to browse your File Explorer for the .sol contract file and .json metadata file for upload.
2. Paste the corresponding contract address you'd like to verify.
3. Ensure **Nautilus Mainnet** is selected in the dropdown.
4. Click the Verify button.
5. Wait for the interface to present a pop-up response with feedback.

## Interacting with verified contracts

NautScan will display the verification status to users when they view the contract page. It is possible for your contract to be fully or partially verified. Partial verification refers to cases when the deployed bytecode of the onchain contract matches the bytecode resulting from the recompilation with the metadata and the source files _but does not match the metadata hash_.

The explorer will also show the source code for verified contracts in the explorer. In future updates, users will be able to create transactions based on the contract's ABI.
